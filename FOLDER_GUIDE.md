# 📁 7-Folder Learning Methodology Guide

## 🎯 Understanding the System

This project implements a systematic learning approach based on Lacan's triad concepts, organized into 7 distinct folders. Each folder serves a specific purpose in the learning and development process.

## 🧠 Theoretical Foundation

### Lacan's Triad Applied to Learning
- **Real** - Measurable, concrete objectives and outcomes
- **Imaginary** - Visual understanding and conceptual models  
- **Symbolic** - Structured knowledge and executable implementations

### The 7-Folder Methodology
This system extends Lacan's concepts into a comprehensive learning framework:

1. **🌍 Real** - Concrete goals and measurable progress
2. **✈️ Journey** - Progressive learning experience
3. **🌳 Environments** - Context and setup infrastructure
4. **🌌 Imaginary** - Visual and conceptual understanding
5. **📐 Formulas** - Patterns and structured knowledge
6. **🔣 Symbols** - Executable implementations
7. **🌀 Semblance** - Learning through errors and iteration
