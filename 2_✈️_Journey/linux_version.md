To adapt your AI CLI Bash script for use within the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you'll need to make a few modifications to ensure compatibility and functionality. Here's a step-by-step guide:

---

### ✅ 1. Use a Portable Shebang

In WSL, it's best to use a shebang that dynamically locates the Bash interpreter. Replace:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

with:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```

This approach ensures that the script uses the Bash interpreter found in your environment's `PATH`, enhancing portability across different systems. ([medium.com][1])

---

### ✅ 2. Convert Line Endings to Unix Format

If you've edited your script on Windows, it might have Windows-style line endings (`CRLF`), which can cause issues in WSL. To convert them to Unix-style (`LF`), use the `dos2unix` utility:

```bash
sudo apt install dos2unix  # Install if not already available
dos2unix your_script.sh     # Replace with your script's filename
```

This conversion removes carriage return characters that can interfere with script execution. ([stackoverflow.com][2])

---

### ✅ 3. Make the Script Executable

Ensure your script has the executable permission:

```bash
chmod +x your_script.sh
```

This step allows you to run the script directly without prefixing it with `bash`.

---

### ✅ 4. Execute the Script

To run your script within WSL:

```bash
./your_script.sh
```

If you encounter a "command not found" error, ensure that the script is in your current directory and that the directory is in your `PATH`.

---

### ✅ 5. Set Environment Variables in WSL

If your script relies on environment variables like `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, set them within your WSL environment:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY='your-api-key'
```

To make this setting persistent across sessions, add the export line to your `~/.bashrc` file.

---

### ✅ 6. Install Required Dependencies

Ensure that all dependencies your script relies on are installed within WSL. For instance, if your script uses `jq` and `curl`:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jq curl
```

This ensures that the necessary tools are available for your script to function correctly.

---

### ✅ 7. Handle File Paths Appropriately

When working with files, be mindful of the differences between Windows and WSL file systems.

* To access Windows files from WSL, use the `/mnt` prefix. For example, `C:\Users\YourName\Documents` becomes `/mnt/c/Users/YourName/Documents`.

* Avoid using Windows-style paths (e.g., `C:\path\to\file`) directly in your script when running under WSL.

This approach ensures that file paths are correctly interpreted within the WSL environment.

---

### ✅ 8. Use `source` for Scripts That Modify the Current Shell

If your script includes commands that change the current shell environment (like `cd`), and you want those changes to persist after the script finishes, run the script using `source`:

```bash
source your_script.sh
```

This executes the script within the current shell session, allowing environment changes to persist.&#x20;

By following these steps, your AI CLI Bash script should function seamlessly within the Windows Subsystem for Linux environment. If you encounter specific issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
